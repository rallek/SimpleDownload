VerySimpleDownload 1.0.0
===========================

VerySimpleDownload is exactly this, what the name is promissing :-). 
* You can upload files to have them available at your site. 
* Some editors do have also plugins for it. 
* Categorisation is available
* and even a two steps workflow is available

Have a look around to see what is there.

I have to say, it is my first module for Zikula I ever published. All of you who know me are knowing, this is only possible by the amazing work of Axel. He is providing with modulestudio a tool which makes it possible to someone like me to create a module like this. Unfortunally I will not be able to do fixing bugs a lot. If you place an issue and you are able to fix it I would be happy to merge your pull request. If not we have to look for someone who may help us ;-).

VerySimpleDownload module generated by ModuleStudio 0.6.1.

This module is intended for being used with Zikula 1.3.5 and 1.3.6.
